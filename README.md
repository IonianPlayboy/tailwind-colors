## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar). 

([`<script setup>`](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/227) is a feature that is currently in RFC stage, and is currently not supported by Vetur. If you have Vetur installed, it's recommended to disable Vetur for the current workspace to avoid conflicts with Volar. )
